                    <h2>The team</h2>
                    <p>LMR was established on the 21st of July 1979, and has been an active lawnmower racing team since then. Our team currently consists of 8 wondeful core racers, some of whom have over 20 years of experience, and another 10 stand-in racers. The core members are: Kristian Hjul, Sonja Motor, Ole Eng, Tonje Ugressmiddel, Harald Gress (who is also our coach), Ellen Klipp (our newest coach), Lavrans Rask and Hubert Pollen. The team was initially established at the University in Oslo (UiO), but has since then moved to NTNU because Trondheim is a much cooler city than Oslo. We have taken part in many competitions such as the Global Lawnmower Racing Race, every year since 2001. We are also looking to join the Lawnmower Grand Prix as soon as we recruit a couple more members.</p>

                    <h2>Lawnmower Racing</h2>
                    <p>Lawnmower Racing is a super fun sport in which you race on top of a lawnmower and look very cool. It involves literally racing on the lawnmower and being extremely fast. Lawnmower Racing was invented in Britain in 1968, and has been a big part of the racing community since then. We have never met anyone who doesn't love lawnmower racing, except those who are allergic to grass. The rules are pretty simple; you drive around on the lawnmower and make sure not to hit anyone on the racing field. It's important to wear proper protection gear such as a helmet because not everyone follows the rule. The most important rule in lawnnmower racing is to have fun and yell as much as possible to scare the other opponents.</p>
